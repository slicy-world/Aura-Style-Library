# Aura Style Library
 This is a library of styles developed in the Aura concept designed for the web.

# What is the idea of the library?
 The idea of the library is very simple - to make a convenient, beautiful and unified style for the web. Anyone can use this library - it stores ready-made elements that you just need to transfer to your project (when specifying the original authorship and specifying changes if they are made).
